# Mind-SC2

## Planning
The full plan will be given in a few days. We need to do some cleanup of our code. The first version of the code (including P vs. T in the mind game) will be released within a week.

## TODO
- [ ] Mind-game model
- [ ] P vs. T in mind-game by ARCL
- [ ] P vs. T in SC2 (Simple64, difficulty 7) by transfer learning
- [ ] Z vs. Z in mind-game by ARCL
